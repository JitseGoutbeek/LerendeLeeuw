Summary:\n\nThis combined text consists of various research studies and reports related to housing and migration patterns in the Netherlands. The studies explore topics such as the potential of flex housing as a supplement to the housing market, the structures of internal migration, the impact of gentrification and suburbanization on urban geographies, and the willingness to pay for apartments. The aim of these studies is to provide policymakers with up-to-date knowledge on household relocation behavior in order to better understand the functioning of the housing market and inform policy interventions. The findings highlight that most people move due to changes in household composition, such as young adults leaving their parental homes or couples deciding to live together. The studies also discuss the limitations of the modeling techniques used and suggest the need for further analysis to improve predictive accuracy. Overall, these studies contribute to a comprehensive understanding of housing dynamics and migration patterns in the Netherlands
