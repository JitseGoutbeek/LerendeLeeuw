* In case you don't have an Hugging Face API key yet, you can register at https://huggingface.co/join
* When registered and logged in, you can get your API key in your Hugging Face profile settings

### Conda virtual environment setup
1. Open an Anaconda prompt or other command prompt
2. Go to the root folder of the project and create a Python environment with conda using commandline command<br>
<code>conda env create -f appl-docchat.yml</code><br>
NB: The name of the environment is appl-docchat by default. It can be changed to a name of your choice in the first line of the yml file
3. Activate this environment using commandline command<br>
<code>conda activate appl-docchat</code>

### Pip virtual environment setup
1. Open an Anaconda prompt or other command prompt
2. Go to the root folder of the project and create a Python environment with pip using commandline command<br>
<code>python -m venv venv</code><br>
This will create a basic virtual environment folder named venv in the root of your project folder
NB: The chosen name of the environment is here appl-docchat. It can be changed to a name of your choice
3. Activate this environment using commandline command<br>
<code>venv\Scripts\activate</code>
4. All required packages can now be installed with command line command<br>
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

### Setting parameters
The file settings_template.py contains all parameters that can be used and needs to be copied to settings.py. In settings.py, fill in the parameter values you want to use for your use case. 
Examples and restrictions for parameter values are given in the comment lines

### Ingesting documents
The file ingest.py can be used to vectorize all documents in a chosen folder and store the vectors and texts in a vector database for later use.<br>
Execution is done in the activated virtual environment using commandline command:<br>
<code>python ingest.py</code>

### Querying documents
The file query.py can be used to query any folder with documents, provided that the associated vector database exists.<br>
Execution is done in the activated virtual environment using commandline command:<br>
<code>python query.py</code>

### Querying multiple documents with multiple questions in batch
The file review.py uses the standard question-answer technique but allows you to ask multiple questions to each document in a folder. 
All the results are gathered in a .csv file.<br>
<code>python review.py</code>

### Ingesting and querying documents through a Streamlit User Interface
The functionalities described above can also be used through a User Interface.<br>
The UI can be started by using commandline command:<br>
<code>streamlit run streamlit_app.py</code><br>
When this command is used, a browser session will open automatically

### Ingesting and querying documents through a Flask User Interface
The functionalities described above can also be used through a Flask User Interface.<br>
The flask UI can be started in the activated virtual environment using commandline command:<br>
<code>python flask_app.py</code>
The Flask UI is tailored for future use in production and contains more insight into the chunks (used) and also contains user admin functionality among others.<br>
For a more detailed description and installation, see the readme file in the  flask_app folder

### Evaluation of Question Answer results
The file evaluate.py can be used to evaluate the generated answers for a list of questions, provided that the file eval.json exists, containing 
not only the list of questions but also the related list of desired answers (ground truth).<br>
Evaluation is done at folder level in the activated virtual environment using commandline command:<br>
<code>python evaluate.py</code><br>
It is also possible to run an evaluation over all folders with <code>python evaluate_all.py</code>

### Monitoring the evaluation results through a Streamlit User Interface
All evaluation results can be viewed by using a dedicated User Interface.<br>
This evaluation UI can be started by using commandline command:<br>
<code>streamlit run streamlit_evaluate.py</code><br>
When this command is used, a browser session will open automatically
